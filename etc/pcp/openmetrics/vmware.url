# URL for pmdaopenmetrics(1) to use with a vmware_exporter process
# running on the localhost. If you are running vmware_exporter on a
# different host (perhaps in a VM on the hypervisor itself), change
# 'localhost' as needed in the URL below.

http://localhost:9272/metrics

# The above URL is for VMWare metrics served by pryorda's vmware_exporter.
# For details, see https://github.com/pryorda/vmware_exporter#readme
#
### Setting up and running vmware_exporter
# The easiest way to run vmware_exporter is to set up a config file 'config.env'
# containing some settings (see below), then launch the pre-built container:
#
# podman run -it --rm -p 9272:9272 --name vmware_exporter --env-fe config.env docker.io/pryorda/vmware_exporter
#
# This container exposes port 9272 on the local host as the /metrics end-point
# for VMware statistics, which the openmetrics PMDA will automatically discover.
# There are about 88 metrics covering all of the important performance related
# information you need to monitor your ESX server and it's resources.

### Setting up config.env
# The file "config.env" (named on the above command line) should contain some
# variable assignments for the host name of the VMware ESX host you want to
# monitor, along with authentication details and a few other settings. Below
# is an example - obviously you'll need to change the values for at least
# VSPHERE_USER, VSPHERE_PASSWORD and VSPHERE_HOST to suit your local site,
# and remove the '#' comment at the start of each line.
#
# -- config.env example --
# VSPHERE_USER=someuser
# VSPHERE_PASSWORD=somepassword
# VSPHERE_HOST=somehostname
# VSPHERE_IGNORE_SSL=TRUE
# VSPHERE_SPECS_SIZE=2000

### PCP metrics
# Once all of the above is setup, VMware metrics should be available in PCP
# on the local host. You can check this with: pminfo -fmdt openmetrics.vmware
